# ICSI418_Team7 - Final Project

This is the final submission for the ICSI 418Y course project by Team 7.

# How to Run the Project

There are two ways to run the project: via a Windows `.exe` file or in the browser using HTML + Live Server.

# 1.Windows Executable (.exe)
- Navigate to the root directory.
- Double-click on `MysticForest.exe` to launch the game.
- No installation or setup required.

# 2.Run in the Browser (HTML version)

**Do NOT open the HTML file directly in your browser**, or you'll see the error:  
`fail to fetch` â€” this happens because the browser blocks local loading of `.wasm` and `.pck` files.

# To run it properly:
1. Open the project in VS Code.
2. Install the Live Server extension if you haven't already.
3. Right-click on `WebPage/Cat&Dog.html` and choose Open with Live Server.
4. The game will now load and run correctly in your browser.
